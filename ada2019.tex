  This project aims to study the Chicago Food Inspections Data and report the results of the analysis on this dataset. Our goal is to qualify a zone if it's safe to eat there or not.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

From the dataset preprocessed at first, we create 2 dataframes : one with all the restaurants and other food establishments, and one with only 5 most inspected chains restaurants (McDonald's, Subway, Starbucks, Taco Bell, Dunkin Donuts). And for each of these dataframes, we analyze the number of inspections, the types of violations and the risk to get finally the map of the Chicago with the scoring of each zone based on these analysis.

\section{Description}

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}
First, we select only elements of dataset that we are interested in : namely the name, facility type, risk, localisation, inspection date, inspection type, result of the inspection and the violations. We process the rows with empty values and also we preprocess the value of each element to be uniform. And finally, for the plotting part, we add the spatial coordinates to the dataframe.



\subsection{Violation Analysis}



\subsection{Inspection Analysis}
For each of the dataframes we get from the preprocessing part, the inspection count per facility type and per chain restaurant has been analyzed. We observe that there is a diminution of the inspections for all facilities types and for all the chain restaurants. And the most frequent inspection type observed is the canvass. For restaurants, we observe lot of inspections by complaints especially in McDonald's.


\subsection{Risk Analysis}


\subsection{Results}



\subsection{Graphics}

{\bf Illustrations}: Place figures, tables, and photographs in the
report near where they are first discussed, rather than at the end, if
possible.  Wide illustrations may run across both columns.

{\bf Captions}: Provide a caption for every illustration; number each one
sequentially in the form:  ``Figure 1. Caption of the Figure.'' ``Table 1.
Caption of the Table.''  Type the captions of the figures and 
tables below the body, using 11 point text.

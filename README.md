# Are we what we eat ?

# Abstract
You have probably already heard the quote "we are what we eat" which is already a quick data analysis, most of the time referring to a link between the quality of our health and the quality of the food we eat. With a food inspection dataset, we hope to find out the relation between food quality and different locations (in the city of Chicago in our case). 

# Research questions
Is there a relation between facility types and locations ?
What facilities are the most inspected ? What are the most often violations per location ?
Combining the risks of each facility in a area, can we discriminate different neighborhoods by the food inspections inside them ?

# Dataset
We are going to use the Chicago Food Inspections dataset. We expect it to mainly show us the connections between locations and the risks (which is a direct link to quality). Then we will need more resources to have the delimitations of different zones in the city according to the governement.

# A list of internal milestones
1) Load the dataset and do a overview analysis of the data (missing values, typing errors, etc).
2) Base on step 1, start a first cleaning of the data.
3) Manipulate the data in order to find all possible correlations that could be interesting in our research.
4) Show analysis results from violations and risks found during the inspections.
5) Optimizing the analysis and a conclusion
